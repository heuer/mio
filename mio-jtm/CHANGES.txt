0.9.4 - 2010-mm-dd
------------------
* The deserializer tries to detect the encoding of the JTM
  instance now. If no BOM was found, the default JSON encoding
  UTF-8 is assumed.
* Fixed bug where topic reference by subject locator were interpreted
  as subject identifier.
* If a key like "reifier" is used i.e. as name value, the value
  is set to 'reifier' instead of '"reifier"'
* The parser accepts more JTM topic maps since it is more relaxed
  regarding the key ordering (does not expect "item_type" / "version"
  at the top of the JTM instance etc.).
* JTM 1.1 support
