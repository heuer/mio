0.9.4 - 2010-mm-dd
------------------
* Added IErrorHandler which gets notified about errors and which
  can decide to stop the mapping process or to log the errors.
* Added a property to log unhandled RDF statements.
* Added a Compact RTM (CRTM) mapping reader which provides
  an alternative, non-RDF mapping syntax.
* Refactored the RDF RTM mapping readers.
  They do not need a triple / quad store anymore and reading 
  the mapping is much more efficient and faster now.
* Fixed issue #4: Create IMapping interface returned by IMappingReader 
  instead of Map<String, IMapper>  
* Fixed issue #5: Create a property to set the mapping
* Added RDFa support
