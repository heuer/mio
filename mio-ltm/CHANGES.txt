0.9.5 - 2011-mm-dd
------------------
* Added more lenient subject locator handling (in non-legacy mode)
* Better error messages which include the expected tokens and 
  information about the line / column in the LTM source.
* Fixed issue #11: The LTM deserializer didn't distinguish between
  #TOPICMAP id and #TOPICMAP ~ id.
* The deserializer allows max. one subject locator
  in the "legacy" mode.
* The deserializer passes now all CXTM tests (previously
  the "invalid" tests were not executed).
* Added support for disabling #INCLUDE and #MERGEMAP directives
  (both are supported by default)
